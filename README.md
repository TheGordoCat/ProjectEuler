# ProjectEuler
These are my Solutions to Project Euler problems. I'm going to keep working on them so I can keep learning more about algorithms, number theory, run-time, and a bit on cryptography. 

Update 3/25/17
Since I'm now top 10% on Project Euler, I'm calculating how long each problem takes to run. I'll keep going back through and updating my solutions to include the run-time and run faster.
